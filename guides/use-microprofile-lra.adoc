= Using MicroProfile LRA in WildFly

https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-2.0/microprofile-lra-spec-2.0.html[MicroProfile Long Running
Actions (LRA)] is a specification that defines the protocol and an API for the distributed transactions based on the
saga pattern and user-defined compensations. In WildFly 28.0.0.Final, we introduced the integration of
https://narayana.io/[Narayana LRA] which implements this specification. In this guide, we look into how you can enable
LRA in your WildFly distribution and how you can use LRA in your applications.

== Overview of the LRA protocol

We provide only a high-level overview of the LRA protocol in this post. The full overview of the protocol is available
at https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-2.0/microprofile-lra-spec-2.0.html.

In LRA, the specification API utilizes annotations from the `org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.annotation` package. The main
annotation is the `@LRA` which controls the life cycle of the LRA. It's use might seem similar to the use of
`@Transactional` annotation from JTA, however, the transaction characteristics differ greatly. If you are interested in
the comparison of the saga pattern to the ACID transactions, you can find an explanation in this talk from DevoxxUK -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DI4xXv1xGU.

The Narayana implementation utilizes the coordinator orchestration of the LRAs. The LRA coordinator is a standalone
service that is responsible for the management operations of the LRAs started in the system. When any LRA participant
(user service) wants to start a new LRA, it contacts the LRA coordinator that in turn returns the LRA ID of the newly
started LRA that can be propagated by the LRA participant to any other services. When an LRA-aware service receives the
LRA ID, it can optionally enlist within the same LRA which is again done by the enlistment call to the coordinator. When
the LRA finishes (success or failure), the LRA coordinator is responsible for invocations of the completions or the
compensations callbacks of all enlisted LRA participants.

== Enabling MicroProfile LRA subsystems

The integration of the LRA specification is included in two separate subsystems:

- `microprofile-lra-coordinator` - The LRA coordinator responsible for starting, managing, and recovery of the LRAs.

- `microprofile-lra-participant` - The client library utilized in user deployments to participate in the distributed LRAs and define compensation and completition callbacks.

=== Required extensions and subsystems configuration

The LRA extensions are not included in the standard configurations included with WildFly application server. They need
to be explitcly enabled either in the configuration XML or by using CLI operations:

[source,bash]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.lra-coordinator:add
{"outcome" => "success"}

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=microprofile-lra-coordinator:add
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "response-headers" => {
        "operation-requires-reload" => true,
        "process-state" => "reload-required"
    }
}

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /extension=org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.lra-participant:add
{"outcome" => "success"}

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=microprofile-lra-participant:add
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "response-headers" => {
        "operation-requires-reload" => true,
        "process-state" => "reload-required"
    }
}

[standalone@localhost:9990 /] reload
----

== Running LRA coordinator in a Docker container

The LRA coordinator is also provided as a standalone Docker image that you can simply run with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 quay.io/jbosstm/lra-coordinator
----

== Using LRA in user deployments

The `@LRA` annotation can be placed on any JAX-RS method to declare that the LRA should be started before the method is
entered and closed (finished successfully) when the method ends. By default, if the JAX-RS method returns any of the 4xx
or 5xx error HTTP status codes the LRA will be cancelled instead.

[source,java]
----
@LRA
@GET
@Path("/doInLRA")
public Response doInLRA(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId) {
    LOG.info("Work LRA ID = " + lraId);
    ...
----

When LRA closes successfully, the LRA coordinator calls the completion callback if the participant defined it:

[source,java]
----
@Complete
@PUT
@Path("/complete")
public Response complete(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId) {
    LOG.info("Complete ID = " + lraId);
    ...
----

Or, in the case of LRA cancel, the compensation callback will be invoked instead:

[source,java]
----
@Compensate
@PUT
@Path("/compensate")
public Response compensate(@HeaderParam(LRA.LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) String lraId) {
    LOG.info("Compensate ID = " + lraId);
    ...
----

The full example is available at https://github.com/xstefank/lra-wildfly-example.

If you deploy this application to WildFly (28.0.0+) with both microprofile-lra-coordinator and
microprofile-lra-participant subsystems enabled, you can make the following HTTP invocation to see how the coordinator
invokes the complete callbacks or the compensation callbacks of the two defined participants:

[source,bash]

You can also always check the currently active LRAs with a direct call to the coordinator API:

[source,bash]
